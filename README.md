# joshs-mnist

This is a repo containing my trials and tribulations while reading [Josh Montague's report](http://joshmontague.com/posts/2016/mnist-scikit-learn/) on how he used the `scikit-learn` library to learn the famous MNIST Dataset. 

Parts of this repo are direct copies from the [repo associated with the article above](https://github.com/jrmontag/mnist-sklearn). For example the [`images.py`](https://github.com/jrmontag/mnist-sklearn/blob/master/images.py) used for interpreting the binaries from the [established MINST website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
